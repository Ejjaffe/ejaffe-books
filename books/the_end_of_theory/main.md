## Introduction
I'm excited to be reading this book, which I hope will be a deeper critique on the parts of classical economics that I found to be less than satisfying in college. Bookstaber is a professor at University of California, formerly at the US Treasury and a risk-manager at Morgan Stanley. 

Bookstaber's main idea is that **classical economic models are too idealized to be useful in our chaotic, imperfect world. He introduces a paradigm called "Agent-Based Economics"**, which I'm excited to compare and contrast with existing approaches to behavioral econ. I am also interested in how this book might be understood by philosophers of science like Kuhn, Feyerabend, or Lakatos, which may require extra reading.

I will be summarizing and adding links or additional mathematical or philosophical notes to chapters, as I see fit.

## Chapter 1
* UChicago economist Robert Lucas: "Economics could not give useful service to the 2008 economic crisis because economic theory has established it cannot predict such crises." He cites two works, one by Watson (2014) called ["Uneconomic Economics and the Crisis of the Model World"](https://www.amazon.com/Uneconomic-Economics-Building-Sustainable-Political/dp/1137385480) p 74-75 (Amazon.com), and Lucas (2009), ["In defense of the dismal science"](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2009/08/06/in-defence-of-the-dismal-science), (The Economist, Paywalled).
